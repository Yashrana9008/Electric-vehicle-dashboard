üöó Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Dashboard using Tableauüåç

I recently developed a comprehensive dashboard to analyze electric vehicle data using Tableau. This interactive dashboard provides a detailed overview of the electric vehicle market, featuring key metrics such as:

- Total Vehicles: 98,621
- Average Electric Vehicle Mileage: 88.40 miles
- Total BEV (Battery Electric Vehicles): 92,709 (94% of total)
- Total PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles): 5,912 (6% of total)

The dashboard allows users to filter data by model year, vehicle make, model, state, and CAFV eligibility. It includes visualizations such as:

- Total Vehicles by Model Year: Highlighting trends and growth over time.
- Total Vehicles by State: A geographical distribution of electric vehicles.
- Top 10 Vehicles by Model and Make: A breakdown of the most popular electric vehicles.
- Total Vehicles by CAFV Eligibility: Insight into the eligibility for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicles.

This project showcases my ability to leverage Tableau for data visualization and analytics, offering valuable insights into the rapidly growing electric vehicle sector.
